BuildingsPy Changelog
---------------------

Version 2.0.1, July 17, 2019 -- Release 2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Avoided text replace in binary files when merging libraries, which lead to
  UnicodeDecodeError. (Issue 272)
- In regression tests, issue error if the name of the reference results
  is too long. (Issue 274)

Version 2.0.0, July 15, 2019 -- Release 2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added handling of library specific comments in buildingspy.development.merger
- Improved error reporting when running regression tests in batch mode.
- Corrected bug when creating and then renaming a package with
  buildingspy.development.refactor
- Removed buildingspy.simulate.Simulator.simulate_translated
  as it relies on non-standard Dymola functionality, and does no longer
  work with Dymola 2019.
  Also removed is the function buildingspy.simulate.Simulator.deleteTranslateDirectory
  which was only needed for buildingspy.simulate.Simulator.simulate_translated

Version 1.7.0, June 14, 2018 -- Release 1.7
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Corrected error in buildingspy.development.regressiontest that caused
  variables in plot statements to be ignored if the plot statement was
  longer than one line. Now, an error message will be written for this case.
- Updated buildingspy.development.merger to filter out certain files,
  such as the top-level .c and .mat files.
- Updated buildingspy.development.refactor.move_class() to
  correct a bug that caused package.mo to not be generated
  if the new class is deeper in the class hierarchy.
- Updated buildingspy.development.refactor.write_package_order() to
  correct a bug in generating package.order file for package-level
  constants.
- Extend class buildingspy.development.validator
  to check the consistency and correctness of .mos and .mo files.
- Added validation of .mos/.mo files to unit test script.

Version 1.6.0, March 29, 2017 -- Release 1.6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- In development.regressiontest.setSinglePackage(packageName), added
  option to provide a comma-separated list to allow checking multiple
  packages.
- In simulate.Simulator, changed quotes of string arguments for
  Modelica parameters.
- In development.regressiontest, added check for redundant connections.
- Updated buildingspy.development.refactor.move_class()
  to allow moving whole packages.
- Updated buildingspy.development.refactor.write_package_order()
  so that also types that are enumerations are added to the package.order file.
- Corrected TypeError during parsing of an exception that led to a wrong
  error message.
- In regression tests for Dymola, added check for missing stateGraphRoot.

Version 1.5.0, March 29, 2016 -- Release 1.5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added module fmi with a function that outputs fmu dependencies.
- Added regression tests for OpenModelica.
- Changed implementation of addParameters(...) to allow
  setting values of parameters that are arrays.
- Corrected bug that lead to files such as .DStore in Resources/Scripts
  to be processed as if they were scripts that run unit tests.
- Added class buildingspy.development.merger, which can be used
  to merge the Annex60 Modelica library to other Modelica libraries,
  such as the Buildings library.
- Corrected bug in copying the files for the unit tests, which
  caused libpython2.7.so not to be copied on some computers
- Added method development.include_fmu_tests that allow testing
  the export of FMUs.
- development.regressiontest now also reports when Dymola
  had to select default initial conditions,
  a model had redundant consistent initial conditions, or
  a model had type inconsistent definition equations.
- Corrected bug in simulate.Simulator that caused a syntax error
  in the Modelica .mos script when setting boolean variables.
- Changed the API of buildingspy.simulate.Simulator.
  Previously, the MODELICAPATH was used as the default
  to load the package.mo file. This was changed because the
  MODELICAPATH variable points one directory higher than the
  location of the package.mo file.
  Now, the current directory is used as the default value, which
  can be overwritten using the parameter packagePath.
- Corrected bug in buildingspy.development.regressiontest that
  only used the first word in the result mat file. This bug
  caused the unit tests to return with an error if for example
  an output file was named Obsolete.FlowMachine
- Corrected bug in buildingspy.development.Validator that
  caused the html section to be not validated if the Modelica
  file contained the </html> and <html> element on the same line.
- Added new module buildingspy.development.refactor that provides
  functions to refactor Modelica libraries.
- Corrected forward and backward slashes in module that runs
  the regression tests.
- Added new function buildingspy.io.outputfile.get_model_statistics,
  which allows obtaining the statistics of the model, such as the
  number of nonlinear equations.
- Added in buildingspy.development.regressiontest.Tester() the
  new function writeOpenModelicaResultDictionary() that writes
  a result dictionary for the OpenModelica regression tests.
- Added regression tests for FMU export for Dymola.
- In regression tests, added a check for parameters that only have
  a start value assigned.
- In buildingspy.development.regressiontest, added functionality
  to save Output, InitialUnknown and Derivatives dependency on
  inputs to the reference results.
- In buildingspy.development.regressiontest, added option to
  use pedantic Modelica check.
- Improved regression tests so that the list of plot variables
  no longer needed to be on a single line. This was done
  as later versions of Dymola do not write line breaks when
  exporting the .mos script.
- Added option to simulate a Modelica model without recompilation.
- In buildingspy.development.regressiontest, added tests for
  differentiation of if-expressions,
  invalid connect statements,
  redeclaration of non-replaceable classes,
  failure to interpret experiment annotation,
  file not found, and
  missing .mos script.
- Corrected html check if the html is on a single line.
- In buildingspy.development.regressiontest, changed reading of
  dslog.txt to be line by line as opposed to the whole file at once.
  The reason is that reading the whole file can give an "out of memory for strings"
  error for very long files as the size of Stringbuffer in
  dymola/source/matrixop.h is not dynamically allocated.


Version 1.4.0, February 28, 2014 -- Release 1.4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- In development.unittest, added test that addresses the situation
  that some results are parameters in the Buildings library, but
  variables in the Annex 60 library.
- In simulate.Simulator, corrected error that prevented output
  files from being copied if the result directory was set to '.'
- Added unit tests and documentation tests.
- Corrected various errors in the documentation.
- Renamed development.unittest to development.regressiontest. This
  was required for the python doctest to work.
- In development.regressiontest, added new method setLibraryRoot(rootDir)
  to allow running the unit tests from a directory other than the library
  root directory.
- In development.regressiontest, added a test that avoids an IndexError
  if a new simulation result contains a different number of support points
  than the reference result. This is needed if models change variables
  to parameters or vice versa.
- In development.regressiontest, added the method setSinglePackage.
  This allows running the regression tests for a single package only.


Version 1.3.0, October 24, 2013 -- Release 1.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added class buildingspy.development.validator
  that can be used to validate the html syntax
  of the info section of .mo files.
- Added validation of html syntax to unit test script.
- In io.outputfile, changed name of argument of _init__
  from format to simulator as format is a reserved keyword
  in Python.
- In simulate.Simulator, corrected use of variable that was not defined.
  Avoided use of variable name exit which is a reserved keyword.
  Avoided the use of temporary variables that are not needed.
- In development.unittest,

  - removed non-needed import statement,
  - removed argument dir from method printNumberOfClasses(self)
    as this argument is not used.

- Updated to latest version of DyMat as on https://bitbucket.org/jraedler/dymat/,
  commit 4e819cb
- In development.Tester, method __getSimulationResults(),
  corrected error that caused results only to be stored if there is
  at least one variable requested for comparison that has more than
  two support points. That is, if a script only requested to store
  parameters, or variables that solely depend on parameters,
  then no results from this simulation were not stored.


Version 1.2.0, May 15, 2013 -- Release 1.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Changed buildingspy.development.unittest so that
  the string 'svn-id' is no longer searched in,
  or written to, the reference result files.
- Improved error reporting of the package that runs
  the unit tests.
- Updated buildingspy.development.unittest to allow testing
  of other libraries than the Buildings library.
- Updated buildingspy.development.unittest to include
  a model check in the pedantic mode of Dymola.


Version 1.1.2, January 8, 2013 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed bug in Simulator.py to allow setting Modelica parameters
  that are of type string.


Version 1.1.1, October 9, 2012 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Improved error reporting in unittest.py
- Fixed bug in constructor of simulate.Simulator.py that caused
    TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'directory'


Version 1.1.0, July 26, 2012 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added class buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.
  This simplifies the creation of boxplot and the
  plotting of data that repeat every day.
- Moved function buildingspy.development.unittest.Tester.__interpolate
  to buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.interpolate
- Caught exception that is caused when non-ascii characters are
  used in the comments of constants, parameters or variables. Now,
  these files are excluded from the unit tests and a warning is issued.
- Centralized error reporting to using buildings.io.reporter instead
  of writing directly to stderr.
- Fixed error in buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.interpolate().
  The previous version could lead to non-increasing time for
  the last time stamp of the results, and then led to an wrong result
  of the interpolation function.
- Changed file output: The output of Dymola is now in the file dymola.log,
  whereas unitTests.log contains the warning and error messages of the python
  unit test scripts.
- Changed buildingspy.development.unittest.py to achieve better load
  balancing. This change reduced the computing time for all unit tests on a
  24 core computer from 38 minutes to 21 minutes.

Version 1.0.0, November 1, 2011
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initial release.
