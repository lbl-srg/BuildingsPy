            .. warning:: This method is experimental. Do not use it without
                         having a backup of your code.

            This function merges the `IBPSA` library into other
            Modelica libraries.

            In the top-level directory of the
            destination library, this function creates the file
            `.copiedFiles.txt` that lists all files that have been
            copied. In subsequent calls, this function
            deletes all files listed in `.copiedFiles.txt`,
            then merges the libraries, and creates a new version of
            `.copiedFiles.txt`. Therefore, if a model is moved
            in the `IBPSA` library, it will also be moved in the
            target library by deleting the old file and copying
            the new file.

            This function will merge all Modelica files,
            Modelica scripts, regression results and images.
            An exception is the file `IBPSA/package.mo`, as libraries
            typically have their own top-level package file that contains
            their release notes and version information.

            When copying the files, all references and file names
            that contain the string `IBPSA` will be renamed with
            the name of the top-level
            directory of the destination library.
            Afterwards, the `package.order` files will be regenerated,
            which allows libraries to have Modelica classes in the same
            directory as are used by the `IBPSA` library, as long
            as their name differs.

            A typical usage is
                >>> import buildingspy.development.merger as m
                >>> import os
                >>> home = os.path.expanduser("~")

                >>> ibpsa_dir = os.path.join(root, "modelica", "IBPSA")
                >>> dest_dir = os.path.join(root, "modelica-buildings", "Buildings")
                >>> mer = m.IBPSA(ibpsa_dir, dest_dir) # doctest: +SKIP
