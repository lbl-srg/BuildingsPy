BuildingsPy Changelog
---------------------

Version 1.2.0, xxxx, 2013 -- Release 1.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Changed buildingspy.development.unittest so that 
  the string 'svn-id' is no longer search in, 
  or written to, the reference result files.
- Improved error reporting of the package that runs
  the unit tests.
- Updated buildingspy.development.unittest to allow testing
  of other libraries than the Buildings library.


Version 1.1.2, January 8, 2013 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed bug in Simulator.py to allow setting Modelica parameters
  that are of type string.


Version 1.1.1, October 9, 2012 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Improved error reporting in unittest.py
- Fixed bug in constructor of simulate.Simulator.py that caused
    TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'directory'


Version 1.1.0, July 26, 2012 -- Release 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added class buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.
  This simplifies the creation of boxplot and the
  plotting of data that repeat every day.
- Moved function buildingspy.development.unittest.Tester.__interpolate
  to buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.interpolate
- Caught exception that is caused when non-ascii characters are
  used in the comments of constants, parameters or variables. Now,
  these files are excluded from the unit tests and a warning is issued.
- Centralized error reporting to using buildings.io.reporter instead
  of writing directly to stderr.
- Fixed error in buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.interpolate().
  The previous version could lead to non-increasing time for
  the last time stamp of the results, and then led to an wrong result
  of the interpolation function.
- Changed file output: The output of Dymola is now in the file dymola.log,
  whereas unitTests.log contains the warning and error messages of the python
  unit test scripts.
- Changed buildingspy.development.unittest.py to achieve better load 
  balancing. This change reduced the computing time for all unit tests on a 
  24 core computer from 38 minutes to 21 minutes.

Version 1.0.0, November 1, 2011
