BuildingsPy is a Python package that can be used to

* run Modelica simulation using Dymola, OpenModelica or OPTIMICA,
* process ``*.mat`` output files that were generated by Dymola, OPTIMICA or OpenModelica, and
* run unit tests and automate other workflows as part of Modelica library development.

The package provides functions to extract data series from
the output file for further use in the python packages
matplotlib for plotting and SciPy for scientific computing.
