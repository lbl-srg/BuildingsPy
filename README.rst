BuildingsPy is a Python package that can be used to

* run Modelica simulation using Dymola
* process ``*.mat`` output files that were generated by Dymola or OpenModelica.
* run unit tests as part of the library development.

The package provides functions to extract data series from 
the output file for further use in the python packages 
matplotlib for plotting and SciPy for scientific computing.
