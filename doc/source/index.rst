buildingspy
===========

*buildingspy* is a `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
package that can be used to:

 - Run Modelica simulations using
   `Dymola <https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola>`_,
   `OpenModelica <https://openmodelica.org/>`_ or
   `OPTIMICA <https://help.modelon.com/latest/reference/oct/>`_.
 - Process ``*.mat`` output files that were generated by
   Dymola, OpenModelica or OPTIMICA.
 - Run unit tests as part of the library development.
 - Refactor Modelica libraries.
 - Merge the `IBPSA <https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa>`_ library to other
   Modelica libraries.

The package provides functions
to extract data series from the output file for
further use in the python packages
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_
for plotting and
`SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_ for scientific computing.
